# Welcome

This is a terminal based 2 D game in Python3 (terminal-based), heavily inspired by Clash of clans where the user will control the king or queen, move it up, down, forward and backward. Concepts of object oriented programming are used in this.

It uses the following OOPS concepts.

```
Inheritance: One Building class is present
Polymorphism: In spell class
Encapsulation: Class Object based ideology is used
Abstraction: Intuitive functionality like move(), attack() etc  methods are within the class.
```



## Instructions to run the game
The orange building is the main building of the village i.e. TownHall.
There is a level system in the game, basically 3 levels with different number of Cannons and Wizard Towers.
The ones with grey color are Cannons.
The ones with Blue color are Wizard Towers.
The ones with Black color are Huts
The movement of Barbarians, Archers and Balloons is automatic i.e. their movement is automated. 

```
